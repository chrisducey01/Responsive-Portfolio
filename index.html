                The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a
                relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for
                buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father
                would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark.
                Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius
                possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring
                we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds - pretty
                standard really.

                Wait a minute, I think I may have lapsed into an old Austin Powers movie quote. The details of my life
                are much less exciting. I was born and raised in IL. About two years ago I moved out to Arizona to be
                closer to family. In addition to working full time and starting this bootcamp, I also just got a new
                puppy a couple weeks ago.  His name is Beau and he's a ten week old yellow lab.  Before this I managed 
                to finally keep a plant alive for more than a week so I like my odds on raising a puppy.
